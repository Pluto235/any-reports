# Mrk 421 / Mrk 501 WCDA Periodicity Analysis v1

Generated from local pipeline outputs in `data/processed/periodicity/{mkn421,mkn501}/`. Current report date: 2026-05-30.

This version keeps the existing Mrk 421 WCDA/Fermi quick-look analysis and the Mrk 501 LHAASO-WCDA weekly light curve. It runs CWT and WWZ checks, then adds a first local-significance assessment for the current Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 WCDA weekly candidate peaks. It also adds a short 2022 Mrk 421 radio-LHAASO alignment supplement.

The updated figures use a clearer layout: the light curve is shown across the first row, while CWT and WWZ maps are separated on the second row. In the regular periodicity section after the xgm poster comparison, WWZ main displays now use linear heatmap color normalization; previous log-color versions are retained as visual references. The period axis remains log-scaled.

## 2022 Radio-LHAASO Short-Window Alignment Supplement

This supplement aligns public 2022 radio flux-density points with the local Mrk 421 LHAASO/WCDA weekly excess-rate proxy. The radio data come from CDS/VizieR `J/A+A/684/A127`, table [`fig1.dat`](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/A+A/684/A127/fig1.dat). Only flux-density rows are used: Metsahovi 37 GHz, IRAM 86/230 GHz, and SMA 225 GHz. The parsed subset has 15 points: 37 GHz = 6, 86 GHz = 4, 225 GHz = 3, and 230 GHz = 2.

The radio points span MJD 59698.7206-59753.7418, and the plot window is padded to MJD 59684.7206-59767.7418. The local WCDA weekly file contributes 12 finite points in this window. The top panel is explicitly labelled `WCDA excess-rate proxy`, computed as `sum(n_on - n_bkg) / tobs`; it is not a calibrated physical flux.

The matching 2022 WCDA daily product, `data/processed/wcda_day/LHAASO-WCDA_Mkn421_2022-04-15_2022-07-07_day.csv`, is still pending, so this report includes the weekly alignment only. This figure is exploratory only and reports no DCF, FAP, correlation coefficient, lag, or QPO significance.

## Local-significance assessment of current candidate peaks

This section freezes the candidate peaks already visible in the Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 WCDA weekly global spectra and asks only whether those fixed peaks look locally unusual under simple red-noise null models. The WCDA series is still `wcda_flux_excess`, a photon-count/excess-rate proxy rather than a final calibrated flux product; this is a workflow pass that should be rerun when calibrated flux is available.

CWT uses `pycwt` Morlet global-wavelet-spectrum references for an AR(1) red-noise null. WWZ uses 1000 AR(1) Gaussian surrogate light curves on the same weekly sampling and reports a local-window FAP within ±10% of each candidate period. CWT and WWZ are two views of the same light curve structure, not independent discoveries. Peaks with only about 3-5 observed cycles should be treated as candidates or hints, not robust QPO detections.

| Source | Method | Period [d] | Cycles | Observed | Local FAP | 95% ref. | 99% ref. | Reading |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Mrk 421 | CWT | 129.87 | 14.17 | GWS 2.965 | — | 11.371 | 14.095 | Below AR(1) 95% local reference. |
| Mrk 421 | CWT | 367.33 | 5.01 | GWS 4.486 | — | 14.675 | 20.042 | Below AR(1) 95% local reference; only about five cycles. |
| Mrk 421 | WWZ | 135.67 | 13.57 | WWZ 4.634 | 0.4665 | 7.442 | 9.232 | Not locally unusual in the AR(1) surrogate test. |
| Mrk 421 | WWZ | 363.22 | 5.07 | WWZ 5.177 | 0.6244 | 15.565 | 21.794 | Not locally unusual in the AR(1) surrogate test. |
| Mrk 501 | CWT | 137.59 | 13.38 | GWS 1.270 | — | 3.687 | 4.593 | Below AR(1) 95% local reference. |
| Mrk 501 | CWT | 389.17 | 4.73 | GWS 4.407 | — | 4.766 | 6.545 | Close to but below the AR(1) 95% local reference; only about five cycles. |
| Mrk 501 | WWZ | 61.22 | 30.07 | WWZ 1.783 | 0.5165 | 2.500 | 2.984 | Not locally unusual in the AR(1) surrogate test. |
| Mrk 501 | WWZ | 140.87 | 13.07 | WWZ 1.761 | 0.7113 | 3.665 | 4.692 | Not locally unusual in the AR(1) surrogate test. |
| Mrk 501 | WWZ | 402.98 | 4.57 | WWZ 6.385 | 0.0310 | 5.233 | 7.726 | Passes this local 95% surrogate check but not 99%; still not a global/post-trial detection. |

Reading: in this first local-only pass, most current weekly peaks are consistent with the simple AR(1) red-noise null. The strongest exception is Mrk 501 WWZ near 403 d, with local-window FAP ≈ 0.031, but it has only about 4.6 cycles and has not been corrected for the period search, two-source comparison, or using both CWT and WWZ.


## Regular WWZ Color-Scale Comparison

Main regular figures now use linear WWZ heatmap color normalization. The Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 WCDA weekly summary figures additionally show CWT and WWZ global spectra below the 2D maps. Red dashed lines mark algorithmic candidate peaks in those global spectra; they are not significance-vetted detections.

## xgm poster 复现检查

Input file: `data/processed/wcda_day/LHAASO-WCDA_Mkn421_2023-06-25_2026-03-29_day.csv`.

This comparison uses `excess_counts = sum(n_on - n_bkg)` as a photon-count flux proxy. It is not a calibrated physical flux, and it is not guaranteed to be the exact same flux definition used in the xgm poster. The xgm poster periods are reference labels from the poster.

Important difference from the xgm poster: the significance curves in this report are my AR(1) Gaussian surrogate WWZ references, computed with `N=1000` surrogates on the same daily sampling and the same saved WWZ period grid. They are not a reproduction of the poster author's significance calculation. Under this null model, the MJD 60200-60700 feature near 51 d is above the pointwise 95% reference but below the pointwise 99% reference, and its ±10% local-window FAP is 0.0619. This explains why it can look stronger in the xgm poster while not passing 99% here. No global look-elsewhere correction is applied.

| Window | xgm poster reported | My reproduction | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 60200-60700 | 51.05 d | Global WWZ peak 111.01 d; nearest 51.05 d grid point is 49.93 d, power 12.330, rank 3 | 50 d is a strong local feature, but not the dominant peak in this run |
| 61020-61098 | 2.54, 5.2, 16.6 d | Global peak at 50.00 d upper boundary; 16.96 d ranks 3, 5.12 d ranks 10, 2.52 d is not prominent | 16.6 d has a visible counterpart; the shorter candidates are weaker here |

| Window | Target source | Target [d] | Nearest grid [d] | Local-window peak [d] | WWZ power | 95% ref. | 99% ref. | Rank | Cycles | My local FAP | Reading |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 60200-60700 | xgm poster reference | 51.05 | 49.92 | 49.92 | 12.330 | 11.017 | 14.897 | 3 | 9.77 | 0.0619 | Above pointwise 95% but below 99% in my AR(1) surrogate reference; does not pass the ±10% local-window 5% FAP threshold. |
| 60200-60700 | my reproduction peak | 111.01 | 111.01 | 111.01 | 13.612 | 15.895 | 21.717 | 1 | 4.49 | 0.0779 | My global peak is stronger than the xgm 51.05 d grid point, but remains below the local AR(1) references. |
| 61020-61098 | xgm poster reference | 2.54 | 2.52 | 2.30 | 0.671 | 0.550 | 0.650 | 24 | 30.31 | 0.0340 | Passes my local 95% and pointwise 99% surrogate check, but the absolute WWZ power is low and this is not trial corrected. |
| 61020-61098 | xgm poster reference | 5.20 | 5.12 | 5.12 | 0.909 | 1.452 | 1.899 | 10 | 14.81 | 0.5095 | Not locally unusual in my AR(1) surrogate test. |
| 61020-61098 | xgm poster reference | 16.60 | 16.96 | 15.28 | 2.767 | 8.582 | 11.784 | 2 | 4.64 | 0.6024 | Visible in my reproduction but not locally significant in this surrogate test. |
| 61020-61098 | my reproduction boundary peak | 50.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 18.573 | 15.768 | 29.757 | 1 | 1.54 | 0.0360 | Above pointwise 95% but below 99%; at the search upper boundary with only 1.54 cycles, so do not treat as a robust QPO. |

Interpretation: this is a comparison between the xgm poster labels and my current reproduction using the available daily `excess_counts` series. The 50 d feature appears locally in the 60200-60700 window, but my global WWZ peak is at longer periods, and the 51 d feature is not above my `N=1000` AR(1) 99% reference. The short-window page shows the clearest counterpart near 16.6 d visually, while only the very-short 2.54 d local-window check crosses the current pointwise 99% reference.
