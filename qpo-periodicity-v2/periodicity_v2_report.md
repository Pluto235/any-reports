# Mrk 421 / Mrk 501 WCDA Flux Periodicity Analysis v2

Generated on 2026-06-03 from strict-batch WCDA flux products.

This v2 report replaces the v1 WCDA photon-count/excess-rate proxy with the strict-batch forward-folded `N0` flux normalization at `E0=3 TeV` with fixed `gamma=2.6`. The Fermi comparison is realigned to the v2 WCDA weekly flux axis.

**Significance scope.** The main v2 CWT/WWZ maps and global spectra remain quick-look periodicity products only. The user-requested xgm MJD 60200-60700 CWT/WWZ targets are assessed with AR(1) surrogates in this pass; no source/method/window-search/post-trial correction is applied.

## Coverage Notes

- WCDA daily flux products currently cover 2021-03-08 to 2025-07-31.
- WCDA weekly flux products currently cover 2021-03-08 to 2025-07-27.
- This is shorter than the v1 counts/proxy products, so v2 does not reproduce late-2025/2026 WCDA-only sections.
- WCDA v2 aligned products apply an uncertainty-outlier QC filter after the `fit_status=OK` strict-flux filter: rows with `N0_err > 5 x median(N0_err)` are excluded per source/cadence, and rejected rows are saved beside each aligned CSV.

## Mrk 421 Fixed Window, MJD 59500-60500

This v2 fixed-window check uses weekly `N0` flux and keeps the v1 140 d target-band localization, but does not run surrogate significance.

| Method | Period [d] | Cycles | Observed power | Significance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CWT strongest | 137.59 | 7.22 | 3.669 | deferred |
| WWZ strongest | 138.89 | 7.16 | 4.776 | deferred |
| CWT targeted 140 d band | 137.59 | 7.22 | 3.669 | deferred |
| WWZ targeted 140 d band | 138.89 | 7.16 | 4.776 | deferred |

## xgm Poster Flux Quick-Look

Only MJD 60200-60700 is rerun with daily `N0` flux. The v1 MJD 61020-61098 poster window is outside the current strict-batch flux coverage and is marked pending.

### xgm Poster Comparison Note

This is not an apples-to-apples comparison with xgm poster page 5: the poster panel uses WCDA counts and a PSD reference-curve display, whereas v2 uses strict-batch daily `N0` flux and reports AR(1) surrogate local/global FAP on the same sampling. The poster's visual >99% reading is therefore not equivalent to a v2 flux >99% claim.

| Case | Input | Method | N | alpha | Local peak [d] | Power | Local FAP | Global FAP | 99% |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| xgm poster page 5 | WCDA counts | WWZ/PSD visual reference | - | - | - | - | - | - | claimed on poster |

### xgm Window WWZ Significance

AR(1) Gaussian surrogates use the same v2 daily flux sampling. Local FAP tests the maximum global WWZ inside target period ±10%; global FAP references the maximum across the same 2-200 d search range. No source/method/window-search/post-trial correction is included.

| Target | Target period [d] | Local peak [d] | WWZ | Local FAP | Global FAP | Above 99% | Nsim |
